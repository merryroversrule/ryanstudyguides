<h2>
About Ryan's Study Guides
</h2>

<p>
	Hello Everyone!
	<br><br>
	My name is <a href="https://ryanbrown.me.uk">Ryan Brown</a> and Iâ€™m a BSc (Hons) Computer Science graduate from Heriot Watt University.
	<br><br>
	I am passionate about learning new things whenever I can and I want everyone to be able to have a chance to do the same.
	Therefore, I have created my own study resources website which will contain comprehensive course notes and revision materials
	to help you complete your courses and hopefully learn something new.
	<br><br>
	I believe that money should never be a barrier to learning, and that is why this website will always be free to use.
	However, if you are able to donate to help towards my hosting fees it would be greatly appreciated. I will continue to add
	more resources, and update existing materials, as much as possible and your donations would be huge help in achieving this.
